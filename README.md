# Parkinsons_Disease_Prediction
Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide, with symptoms ranging from tremors and muscle rigidity to impaired balance and difficulty in walking. Early detection of PD is crucial for effective treatment and improved quality of life for patients. However, diagnosing PD in its early stages remains challenging, often leading to delayed intervention and missed opportunities for timely treatment.

This project aims to develop a machine-learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of an individual developing Parkinson's Disease based on specific features and biomarkers. By harnessing advanced data analytics techniques and machine learning algorithms, we aim to create a reliable predictive tool that can aid healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at risk of PD at an early stage.
